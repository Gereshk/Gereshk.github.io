# PNPT Accelerated Course
Hello everyone.  In this blog post I will be discussing my experience with the PNPT accelerated course that I took for the month of July.  I was doom scrolling Linkedin one day and I saw a post for the first PNPT accelerated course that TCM was offering.  Not to sound to much like a fanboy but I am an exsiting customer of TCM being on their subscription plan since I first signed up for their platform approximately a year ago and even paying for a coaching call with Heath about 6 months ago. I have been wanting to transition my career from the System Admin side of IT into the Cybersecurity side for about as long. I had distant plans of taking the PNPT, but had other certifications in mind first.  Mainly the OSCP offered be Offensive Security because I want to transition my career directly into Penetration testing and that is what everyone says is the "Gate Keeper" certification. Also around the same time TCM Security debuted a new Certification the PJPT (Pratical Junior Penetration Tester).  I decided to take the money I was saving for the OSCP and put it towards the PJPT and the PNPT Accelerated course

# Price
The Price was a sticker shock to me to start.  2999.99,  Three Thousand dollars seems like ALOT of money all at once, and it is.  I know many people who want to go down this path unaware of the price tag associated to a single certification let alone the amount of some of the other course/exam attempt that are in this field.  Also considering everything that was covered in this course it became more palatteable.  

## What is included 
The PNPT training bundle which includes Lifetime access to the following TCM Security Courses
- Practical Ethical Hacking
- Windows Privilege Escalation
- Linus Privilege Escalation
- Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- Extenal Pentest Playbook
- PNPT Live Training VOD
    + This seems to be the twitch stream that TCM Security did awhile back
- Exam Attempt
    + Free retake if you should need it
- Lab enviornment so that you don't have to use your own resources to set up the Labs
- A special Discord group in TCM's Discord with your Cohort peers
Plus you every Friday you get an 8-hour class hosted by the TCM Security team (mostly Heath but others were there).

### The live Classes
I have to be honest here if you have been studying the courses and doing the work this might not be for you.  A lot of the information is exactly the same as you will get in the courses.  The main difference and what I feel was the best part of the course was the ability to interact with the instructors and have them expand on a topic you might not quite understand.  As well as answer general questions.  Heath our main instructor for the course was very thoughtful of meeting people where they were and assisting everyone.  Joe and Zach were there to answer career questions.  Alex was great to have answer all your Web/AppSec quesitons.

### The Labs
The labs were not kind to the first cohort that went through.  I could tell there were growing pains with the platform and their were issues with the labs from day one.  To be fair The TCM team did a great job of fixing the issues as soon as possible or adding more total time that we were alotted due to the issues.  The Labs are the exact same ones that need to be set up for the PEH course so fortunately for me as I had already been studying the course I was just able to spin my labs up and work along with the instructor.
