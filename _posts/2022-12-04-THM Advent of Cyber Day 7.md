## Overall Thoughts

Cyber Chef is a great tool and one of the my first stops when needing to decode a hash.  This room took Cyber Chef a lot deeper and I really enjoyed seeing all the different tools that it has baked right in (Pun Intended).

### The room 

This room is more of a follow the leader with the instructions so lets do that until we can start anwswering the questions

#### Question 1

![q1](/assets/AOCD7/q1.png)

The answer to this question is easily found in the URL in the address bar

#### Question 2

![q2](/assets/AOCD7/q2.png)

This is an easy one just follow the instructions and then count the number of recipes used to get the extracted URL's

#### Question 3

![q3](/assets/AOCD7/q3.png)

Look in the results of the urls and you will find the answer to this question easily

#### Question 4

![q4](/assets/AOCD7/q4.png)

Again this can be found in the results of the recipe 

![URLs](/assets/AOCD7/URLs.png)

#### Question 5

![q5](assets/AOCD7/q5.png)

Last question is again in the results of the recipe just follow the instructions in the written format or watch the video provided by SecurityZNinja

### Conclusion
Again I love Cyber Chef and I enjoyed finding more tools that are stored in it.  Although this was a follow the leader type of room it was good learning about the tools.  I guess with the number of tools in cyber chef if you didnt follow the leader you could go down a long rabbit hole trying to figure out the right recipe.
