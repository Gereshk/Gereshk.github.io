## Overall Thoughts

I had a bad connection to this room but managed to get it done.  Very fun room learning about malware anyalsis.

### Getting Started 

I'm going to be using the attack box provided by tryhackme.  So i get that spun up.

I had a lot of issues staying connecte to the attack box.  So I did not get any screenshots and my notes are all over the place.  If I am able to I will get a write up in here.  If not please just follow the instructions or watch the video by [HuskyHacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdQZPLRnr3g)
