## Overall Thoughts

The task has us looking at smart contracts.  To be honest this is the first time I have looked at ETH block chain and the smart contracts

### The room 

This room is a definately a follow the instructions.  I followed the instructions and even got lost a bit and ended up slightly confused.

#### Question 1

Once you work through the instructions the flag will show up.

### Conclusion
There was not much to do as far steps.  Just follow the instructions and you will get there.
